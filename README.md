Purpose: This assignment is designed to:
 Introduce basic document structure
 Introduce basic document styling
Task: Create an horizontal navigation menu that displays drop-down menu but-
tons.
Discussion: Navigation menus are quite common in web design. For this assign-
ment, the menu should have the following organization:

We can accomplish such an organization by structuring the content within an
unordered list using the <ul> tag:

. . .
</ul>
Styling the menu into a horizontal presentation with drop-down tabs requires
a selection of coordinated CSS rules; use the following articles on CSS menus as a
